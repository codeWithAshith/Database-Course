-- Stored Procedures

The following SELECT statement returns all rows in the table customers from the sample database:

SELECT 
    customerName, 
    city, 
    state, 
    postalCode, 
    country
FROM
    customers
ORDER BY customerName;

When you use MySQL Workbench or mysql shell to issue the query to MySQL Server, MySQL processes the query and returns the result set.

If you want to save this query on the database server for execution later, one way to do it is to use a stored procedure.

The following CREATE PROCEDURE statement creates a new stored procedure that wraps the query above:

By definition, a stored procedure is a segment of declarative SQL statements stored inside the MySQL Server. In this example, we have just created a stored procedure with the name GetCustomers().

Once you save the stored procedure, you can invoke it by using the CALL statement:

CALL GetCustomers();

The first time you invoke a stored procedure, MySQL looks up for the name in the database catalog, compiles the stored procedureâ€™s code, place it in a memory area known as a cache, and execute the stored procedure.

If you invoke the same stored procedure in the same session again, MySQL just executes the stored procedure from the cache without having to recompile it.

A stored procedure can have parameters so you can pass values to it and get the result back. For example, you can have a stored procedure that returns customers by country and city. In this case, the country and city are parameters of the stored procedure.

A stored procedure may contain control flow statements such as IF, CASE, and LOOP that allow you to implement the code in the procedural way.

A stored procedure can call other stored procedures or stored functions, which allows you to modulize your code.

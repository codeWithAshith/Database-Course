This query returns data from both tables customers and payments using the inner join

SELECT 
    customerName, 
    checkNumber, 
    paymentDate, 
    amount
FROM
    customers
INNER JOIN
    payments USING (customerNumber);

Next time, if you want to get the same information including customer name, check number, payment date, and amount, you need to issue the same query again.

One way to do this is to save the query in a file, either .txt or .sql file so that later you can open and execute it from MySQL Workbench or any other MySQL client tools.

A better way to do this is to save the query in the database server and assign a name to it. This named query is called a database view, or simply, view.

By definition, a view is a named query stored in the database catalog.

To create a new view you use the CREATE VIEW statement. This statement creates a view customerPayments based on the above query above:

CREATE VIEW customerPayments
AS 
SELECT 
    customerName, 
    checkNumber, 
    paymentDate, 
    amount
FROM
    customers
INNER JOIN
    payments USING (customerNumber);

Once you execute the CREATE VIEW statement, MySQL creates the view and stores it in the database.

Now, you can reference the view as a table in SQL statements. 
For example, you can query data from the customerPayments view using the SELECT statement:

SELECT * FROM customerPayments;
